    We all tend to take the independence that comes from driving
    for granted, until itâ€™s gone. When that happens, our world 
    suddenly seems small. This is exactly the plight of thousands 
    of seniors and vision impaired adults in our communities across 
    metropolitan Detroit.  Independence Rides is all about dignified 
    transportation for seniors and vision impaired adults in the 
    greater Detroit area.
